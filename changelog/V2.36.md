# Game Balance & Game Patch Changelog

## Version 2.36 - 2025-08-28

### Major Features
- **Dynamic Factory Cost System**: Added dynamic factory cost specifically when entering a Tech & Layer for the first time. Players receive a 2x buildtime with 35% Mass & 80% Energy increase for the first factory of tech & layer that they upgrade. This is stored and remembered for each specific brain that performed the upgrade, allowing each player to face this increase when they do their first initial tech upgrade. This avoids importing all the code for the HQ System of FAF but gives a similar system with much cheaper performance and maintenance cost.
