# Game Balance & Game Patch Changelog

## Version 2.06 - 2025-04-21
### General Changes
- **T1 Land Scouts**
    - Radar Radius: 48 -> 64
    - Vision Radius: 28 -> 42
- **Add Future Support for Formation Improvements**
- **Introduce Significant Buildtime & Small Cost Reductions for Experimentals**
    ### **Cost Adjustments**
    - Added tiered cost reduction system for experimental units
    - Includes both LAND, AIR, & NAVAL experimentals
    - Implemented IgnoreEvenflow for all experimental units

    ### **Light Experimentals (10k-16k mass range)**
    - Units ≤10.5k mass → reduced to 10k mass
    - Units ≤12.5k mass → reduced to 11k mass
    - Units ≤15k mass → reduced to 12k mass
    - Units >15k mass → reduced to 13k mass
    - Energy costs scaled proportionally with mass reduction

    ### **Heavy Experimentals (≥34.5k mass)**
    - 20% reduction to mass cost
    - 20% reduction to energy cost

    ### **Build Time Scaling**
    - Base build time starts at 10k mass
    - Scales to 22k build time at 20k mass
    - Continues scaling linearly from there
    - Minimum build time of 15k seconds
    - Build time calculation based on final (reduced) mass cost

    ### **Example Build Times**
    - 10k mass → 15k build time
    - 20k mass → ~24k build time
    - 30k mass → ~36k build time
    - 40k mass → ~48k build time
