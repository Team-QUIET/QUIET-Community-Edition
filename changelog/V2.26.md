# Game Balance & Game Patch Changelog

## Version 2.26 - 2025-07-19
### General Changes
    - **Formation Overhaul**
    <p>The formation system has been completely overhauled with a new modular architecture. This update introduces multi-pattern caching to eliminate redundant calculations, resulting in faster and more efficient formation building. Players can now experience simpler but more responsive formations, (Current Formations): Grid and StarCluster, thanks to the use of formation blueprints. The system intelligently selects specialized formations for different unit roles (such as shields, anti-air, and more), and optimizes data structures and algorithms for improved performance and lower memory usage. Additionally, Formation Scaling has been added, ensuring better unit spacing and visual consistency when mixing units of different sizes.</p>
    - **Energy Drain for Continuous Beam Units**
        - Fixed energy drain system for continuous beam weapons (weapons that fire continuously rather than in discrete shots)
        - Continuous beam units now use a per-tick energy drain system that provides smooth, responsive energy consumption
        - Energy drain stops immediately when the beam is disabled
        - Added proper energy requirements: units need sufficient stored energy to both start AND sustain firing
            - Example: A laser beam unit with 400 EnergyRequired and 400 EnergyDrainPerSecond will need 400 + (400 Ã— 5) = 2,400 total energy to fire for 5+ seconds 
        - Non-continuous weapons (projectiles, missiles, etc.) continue to use the original energy system
        - Fixes Various Laser Based Units not firing (missing their laser)
    - **New Aeon Shield Shaders**
        - Introduced New Aeon Shield Shaders that look far more visible then the older ones.
