# Game Balance & Game Patch Changelog

## Version 1.75 - 2024-12-27
### General Changes

### Changelog Comments:
- `AA`: Mobile AA is nerfed in Muzzle Velocity due to it's ability to hit high fast flying targets unintentionally. This has been corrected, and it can now no longer tear apart T3 & T2 Bombers/Fighters, but should still work against Gunships.
- `SAMs/Flak`: SAMs & Flak have been diversified to encourage players to build them versus different options. Flak is intented to be used versus Gunships. SAMs are intended to be used versus Fighters & Bombers. Damage on Both Flak & SAMs has been increased to counter T3 Gunships/Bombers a bit better. Seraphim SAM should perform significantly better and not miss. SAMs lost a good bit of their HP while Flak gained HP (Cybran is excluded due to their high regen, they have gained).
