# Game Balance & Game Patch Changelog

## Version 1.83 - 2025-01-05
### General Changes
- Removed MaintenanceCostEnergyPerSecond from T2 and T3 Sniper as It wasn't needed to balance the unit and It was not working as intended.

### Comment:
Energy Review was done in order to account more accurately for Stealth / Mobile Stealth as It should be treated in a similar way to Mobile Shields & Personal Shields.
