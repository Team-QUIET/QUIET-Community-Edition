# Game Balance Changelog

## Version 1.65 - 2024-10-30
### General Changes
- **T3 Barrage Artillery (All Factions)**
  - **Rate of Fire**: Corrected to `10/90` from `10/10`
    - Explanation: The T3 Barrage Artillery had an extremely high rate of fire due to an error, allowing it to fire much faster than intended. This change brings the Rate of Fire in line with the intended balance.
  - **Turret Yaw Range**: Fixed to `180`
  - **Turret Yaw Speed**: Fixed to `50`
    - Explanation: The turret's Yaw Range and Speed were incorrectly set, causing the artilleryâ€™s weapons to misalign and conflict with one another when aiming at targets. These adjustments ensure that the weapons can rotate smoothly and operate as designed.
  - **Target Check Interval**: Lowered to `1` from `3`
    - Explanation: The interval for target checks has been reduced to allow for quicker target acquisition, improving the responsiveness of the artillery.

- **T2 UEF Shield Boat**
  - **Shield Max Health**: Reduced from `8500` to `5500`
  - **Shield Energy Drain Recharge Time**: Reduced from `6.2` to `5`
  - **Shield Regen Rate**: Increased from `55` to `80`
  - **Shield Regen Start Time**: Increased from `2` to `3`
  - **Shield Size**: Increased from `62` to `120`
  - **Shield Spill Over Damage Modifier**: Set to `0.50` (This was previously `15%` but had a special `50%` damage spillover specific to shield boats)
  - **Shield Vertical Offset**: Changed from `-15` to `-50`
  
  **Explanation**:
  - The **Shield Max Health** was reduced to make the unit less durable, as its previous values made it too strong in prolonged engagements.
  - The **Shield Energy Drain Recharge Time** was lowered to `5`, improving the recharge efficiency of the shield and helping it stay operational more frequently.
  - **Shield Regen Rate** was increased to enhance the shield's survivability despite the health reduction, making it regenerate faster once active.
  - Increasing the **Shield Regen Start Time** balances the increased regen rate, giving a slight delay before regeneration starts.
  - The **Shield Size** was expanded to `120` to cover a larger area, making the unit more effective in protecting nearby units.
  - The **Shield Spill Over Damage Modifier** was adjusted to `50%` to make the damage spillover mechanic more consistent with how shield boats are supposed to function, compared to the previous setting that allowed `15%` spillover, making the shields overly effective against splash damage.
  - The **Shield Vertical Offset** was adjusted to prevent air units from flying under it.
