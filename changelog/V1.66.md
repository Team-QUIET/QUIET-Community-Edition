# Game Balance & Game Patch Changelog

## Version 1.66 - 2024-10-30
### General Changes
- **Overrall`
  - Fixed Units getting stuck in their packing/unpacking animations `Part 6`

- **T3 Cybran Penetrator Gunship`
    - Explanation: The Penetrator Gunship had mobility issues that prevented its lasers from firing consistently. Expanding the yaw and arc heading ranges addresses this issue, improving weapon alignment.
  - **Arc Heading Range**: Increased from `50` to `180`
  - **Turret Yaw Range**: Increased from `50` to `180`

- **T2 Fighters`
    - Explanation: T2 Fighters struggled to hit high-speed bombers and gunships due to their damage radius. The damage radius has been reverted to 0, and rate of fire increased to enhance their effectiveness, especially against T1 Fighters.
  - **Projectile Lifetime Multiplier**: Set to `1.5`
  - **Damage Radius**: Reverted from `2` to `0`
  - **Rate of Fire**: Increased from `20/10` to `25/10`

- **T4 Aeon Avernus**
    - Explanation: The Avernus was gaining veterancy too quickly and had a high regen rate at higher veterancy levels, creating balance issues. The kill requirements and regen rates have been adjusted to curb this.
  - **Veterancy Kills**: Adjusted thresholds for each level: Level1=`200`, Level2=`350`, Level3=`450`, Level4=`500`, Level5=`650`
  - **Regen Rate**: Adjusted per level: Level1=`5`, Level2=`10`, Level3=`15`, Level4=`30`, Level5=`60`

- **T3 Seraphim Land**
    - Explanation: The T3 Ilsatha unit underperformed for its cost, especially after the Otheekaâ€™s removal. A damage and muzzle velocity buff makes it more effective and worth its cost.
  - **Removed Otheeka**
  - **T3 Ilsatha**
    - **Damage**: Increased from `55` to `65`
    - **Muzzle Velocity**: Increased from `30` to `40`

- **T3 Cybran Land**
    - Explanation: The T3 Cybran Slink's effectiveness was too high for its energy upkeep and build time, leading to an imbalance. These changes adjust its costs and damage output to better balance its role as a unique T3.5 MAA unit.
  - **Removed Crawfish**
  - **T3 Slink**
    - **Damage**: Increased from `120` to `180`
    - **Energy Cost**: Increased from `12500` to `16500`
