# Game Balance & Game Patch Changelog

## Version 1.79 - 2024-12-30
### General Changes

- **General Changes**
    - Fix Shield.lua Personal Shields initializing legacy code instead of the New Shield.lua Code
    - Fix Shield.lua not carrying default values resulting in some Nil Values
    - Shield.lua now applies to all Shield Types (Personal, Bubble, and etc) meaning that Personal Shields now interact correctly with AoE Weapons not allowing AoE to damage the base Health of the Unit. The Shield is now treated as an additional health layer to the Unit and no longer carries it's own collision sphere/box. Damage that overkills the shield now applies onto the base health of the unit.
    - Fix Multiple Units with Rate Of Fire Errors (many having too short of Rate of Fires)
