## Tier 2

## Tier 3

## Tier 4

# Land | Sea | Air

### T1 Sea
- `Frigate:` AA should be generally less effective and Early Game Naval MUST be supported by the Air and no Navy should be allowed to this Air Support without suffering significantly from Enemy Torpedo Bombers. Torpedo Defense should be much less effective and only come in as a stopgap method whether then a full defense method.
- `Submarines:` should not be able to fill a frontline role and should be subsectioned to Support Roles in formations of Battleships, Destroyers, and Frigates. They should be able to be used to support the frontline, but not BE the frontline.
### T2 Sea
- `Cruisers:` Each Faction's Cruiser serves a different purpose and should be able to be used to support the frontline, but not BE the frontline. They should have a more effective AA then Frigates & Mobile Hover Flak as well as any other form of AA that might not be a naval asset.
