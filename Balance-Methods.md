# Land | Sea | Air
### Interaction Between Layers

## Air | Sea
The Air Interaction with Sea is the most complex and interesting of all. Air must be able to control the Sea, but also the Sea must be able to control the Air. This dynamic is important with all maps with large open seas. 
Torpedo Bombers must be very effective against Naval. `V1.72 & Below`, they fail to deliver the punch they should and are easily killed by the Naval. This is especially true for players with a lot of Frigates. Frigate AA stands as far too effective currently. Frigate AA should be generally less effective and Early Game Naval MUST be supported by the Air and no Navy should be allowed to this Air Support without suffering significantly from Enemy Torpedo Bombers. Torpedo Defense is also currently far too strong and can reduce DPS by always 50% in many cases. Torpedo Defense should be much less effective.
