# Land | Sea | Air

### T1 Sea
- `Frigate:` AA should be generally less effective and Early Game Naval MUST be supported by the Air and no Navy should be allowed to this Air Support without suffering significantly from Enemy Torpedo Bombers. Torpedo Defense should be much less effective and only come in as a stopgap method whether then a full defense method.
- `Submarines:` should not be able to fill a frontline role and should be subsectioned to Support Roles in formations of Battleships, Destroyers, and Frigates. They should be able to be used to support the frontline, but not BE the frontline.
### T2 Sea
- `Cruisers:` Each Faction's Cruiser serves a different purpose and should be able to be used to support the frontline, but not BE the frontline. They should have a more effective AA then Frigates & Mobile Hover Flak as well as any other form of AA that might not be a naval asset. 
- `Destroyers:` Each Faction's Destroyer serves a different purpose and should be able to be used to as the frontline. Frigates will most likely continue to be used till Tech 3 Phase in which they will be phased out however during the Tech 2. They most likely will still see heavy usage. Destroyers have (receiving a -200 mass discount) should be able to more cost effective. They serve as a long range kiting force; Frigates will soak most of the damage till the Tech 3 Phase, in which by then Destroyers will be the main soaking force for Battleships.
- `Submarines:` T2 Submarines Torpedo Defense has been completely removed, this means they will not be able to fight other Submarines effectively, unless with the best micro (this is intentional). Submarines will be used for ambushing and killing enemy ships reinforcing and such to the Combat Zones (i.e imagine Seton's Clutch 20km in a Gyle Cast)
### T3 Sea 
- `Submarines:` T3 Submarines Torpedo Defense has been completely removed as well as their sonar stealth. These two submarines are used VASTLY different from T2 Submarines. The Assault Submarine (Cybran) is a frontline submarine (highest hp and the most numerous torpedos to overwhelm destroyer TD) meant to make up for their lacking battleship and the Seraphim Submarine is used to support via ambushing and flanking, it has the highest damage output of all submarines and fastest torpedos (but lowest hp except for T1 Submarines).
- `Battleships:` Battleships have been directly been buffed in both HP, Damage, and Range. They are the backbone of the Navy supported by their Destroyers, Submarines, and Cruisers. They are the most expensive unit in the Naval Area. They will be used for the frontline and will be the most difficult to kill.
